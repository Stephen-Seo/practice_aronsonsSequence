Aronson\u2019s sequence 1, 4, 11, 16, 24, 29, 33, 35, 39, \u2026 (A005224) is
an infinite self-referential sequence defined as:

    T is the first, fourth, eleventh, \u2026 letter in this sentence.

Your task is to write a program that generates Aronson\u2019s sequence and use
it to compute the first hundred members of the sequence. When you are finished,
you are welcome to read or run a suggested solution, or to post your own
solution or discuss the exercise in the comments below.
